# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Phase 8 - Polish & Advanced Features

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Next.js + Phaser.js game - all game logic is in /game folder
- Use `npm run build` to verify code compiles (no test suite yet)
- Phaser scene is in game/core/MainScene.ts
- Game state is managed by GameStateManager.ts
- Phase transitions handled by PhaseStateManager
- Combat system in CombatPhaseSystem.ts
- Ship types: Scout, Frigate, Destroyer (see game/types/index.ts)
- TILE_SIZE is 16px (defined in GameConfig.ts)
- Map is 48x36 tiles, procedurally generated
